"""Pure data models + helpers for the Govee LAN (UDP) transport (issue #57).

This module hosts the Govee LAN (UDP) transport (issue #57). Its first two
concerns are pure functions over plain data, trivially testable without hardware
or sockets:

1. ``parse_dev_status`` — turn a raw ``devStatus`` reply payload into a frozen
   :class:`LanDevStatus`. Govee's LAN ``devStatus`` reply exposes EXACTLY four
   runtime fields and nothing else (per ``docs/govee-protocol-reference.md`` §5.3
   and the reference libraries ``Galorhallen/govee-local-api`` +
   ``wez/govee2mqtt``): ``onOff``, ``brightness`` (0-100), ``color`` ``{r,g,b}``
   (whole-device) and ``colorTemInKelvin``. We extract those four and never
   fabricate anything else — a partial, wrong-command or undecodable datagram
   yields ``None`` so a malformed reply can never overwrite real device state.

2. ``correlate_scan`` — map the device identifiers reported by a LAN ``scan``
   onto the coordinator's known ``device_id`` values, so a later wave can decide
   which devices may use the LAN transport. Matching is exact-string first, then
   a hex-normalized fallback (MAC formatting differs between the scan reply and
   the developer API). Groups are skipped, IPs are NEVER guessed, and unmatched
   scan records are returned so MAC-format drift stays observable in diagnostics.

3. :class:`GoveeLanClient` — the coordinator-owned persistent client that owns
   the live UDP sockets (the only I/O in this module). It implements the
   lifecycle and the dual-socket design (a group-joined :4002 receive socket
   plus a dedicated ephemeral send socket) and forwards every inbound datagram
   to an injected callback. The public read/send surface and the
   parse-and-dispatch wiring arrive in a later wave (LAN-009).

       scan responses and unsolicited multicast devStatus pushes.

    catches the ``OSError``, logs once, and leaves the client DISABLED
