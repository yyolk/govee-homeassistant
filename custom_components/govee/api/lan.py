"""Read-only Govee LAN (UDP) observation helper.

Govee exposes a local UDP control API (must be toggled on per device in the
Govee app) on a subset of mostly-light SKUs. This module performs ONLY read-only
probes so a user can capture which of their devices answer on the LAN and what
state they report, and attach it to a diagnostics download. That community data
is the prerequisite for the full LAN transport requested in issue #57 (the
maintainer has no LAN hardware to test against).

Two probes, both safe to attach to a diagnostics download:

- ``async_scan_lan_devices`` — one bounded multicast ``scan`` (discovery): which
  devices answer and their identity/firmware metadata.
- ``async_probe_lan_raw`` — a "reality probe": fire a battery of safe READ-ONLY
  queries (``devStatus`` + ``status`` + a unicast ``scan``) at each discovered
  device and capture **every** datagram it emits, completely unfiltered — whole
  payload, any command, any field, even undecodable bytes. We do NOT trust any
  other integration's notion of which commands exist or which fields a reply
  carries (``govee-local-api`` parses only 4 ``devStatus`` fields and never sends
  ``status`` at all); the point is to measure on real hardware what the firmware
  actually exposes rather than inherit someone else's parser. In particular the
  ``status`` command's ``pt`` (BLE-passthrough hex) field may carry
  segment/scene/sensor state that the 4-field ``devStatus`` omits.

``ptReal`` and the other control verbs (``turn``/``brightness``/``colorwc``) are
deliberately NOT sent: they are state-changing writes, forbidden in this
read-only module. Capturing what the device *volunteers* in response to read
queries is the safe way to map the surface.

Deliberately scoped: no control writes, no entities, no persistent socket — each
call opens a socket, collects responses for a short timeout, and returns them.
Protocol per ``docs/govee-protocol-reference.md`` §6:

- Scan request    -> 239.255.255.250:4001  ``{"msg":{"cmd":"scan",...}}``
- Scan response   -> 239.255.255.250:4002  ``{"msg":{"cmd":"scan","data":{...}}}``
- Read queries    -> <device-ip>:4003/4001 ``{"msg":{"cmd":"devStatus|status|scan","data":{}}}``
- Replies         -> our :4002 (unicast OR multicast, firmware-dependent)

Critical protocol detail (the reason early builds returned zero devices, issue
#57): a Govee device sends its scan *response* as **multicast** to the group on
port 4002 — it does NOT unicast the reply back to the sender. So the receive
socket MUST join the ``239.255.255.250`` group via ``IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP`` or the
kernel silently drops every reply before it reaches us. Binding port 4002 alone
is not enough. The reality probe reuses the same group-joined 4002 socket so it
catches replies whether a given firmware answers unicast or multicast. This
mirrors ``govee-local-api`` (the library behind Home Assistant's
``govee_light_local``) and ``wez/govee2mqtt``.
