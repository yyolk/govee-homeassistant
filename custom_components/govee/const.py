#   "auto"       -> convert only for SKUs in FAHRENHEIT_REPORTING_SKUS (default)

#   H717A (smart kettle): reports its temperature in °F under the °C-tagged
#     native unit, so 187°F surfaced as 187°C — impossible for a kettle (water
#     boils at 100°C); real value ~86°C (issue #115).
#   H5106 / H5140 (air-quality / CO₂ monitors): report °F as a plain float
#     (e.g. 73.9°F ≈ 23.3°C), surfaced under the °C unit as a "wrong large
#     value". Confirmed by reporter diagnostics (issue #116) — they are NOT
#     centi-encoded, just Fahrenheit; same class as #72/#78/#96.

# LAN transport constants (issue #57)
# Runtime tuning for the local UDP (:4002/:4003) transport. These are NOT
# user-facing options — the only LAN option is CONF_LAN_TARGETS (above), which
# feeds extra cross-VLAN unicast scan targets. LAN auto-enables when a device
# answers the discovery scan and its scan MAC correlates to a coordinator
# device_id; there is no enable toggle.

# Wall-clock window (seconds) for one shared solicited read-batch collection.
# Bounds how long async_read_batch waits to gather devStatus replies.
LAN_READ_WINDOW: Final = 1.0

LAN_WRITE_CONFIRM_TIMEOUT: Final = 0.5
# How often (seconds) to re-run the LAN discovery scan and re-correlate scan

LAN_READ_MISS_DEMOTE_THRESHOLD: Final = 3
# Consecutive LAN write-confirm failures (verify-by-read timeout OR value
# mismatch) before LAN write *attempts* are suppressed for a device. Issue #57:
# LAN transport health is READ-driven — a write whose readback does not confirm
# (a freshly-powered controller reporting its pre-command state late, or simply
# answering the confirm read after LAN_WRITE_CONFIRM_TIMEOUT) must NOT flip the
# lan_connectivity sensor off, which produced a flap synced to control activity
# (the reported symptom). Instead, after this many consecutive unconfirmed
# writes the device's writes skip the LAN attempt (and its confirm-read wait)
# and go straight to MQTT/REST for LAN_WRITE_SUPPRESS_SECONDS, while LAN reads
# keep working and the sensor stays Connected. A confirmed write or the cooldown
# expiry re-arms LAN writes.
LAN_WRITE_SUPPRESS_THRESHOLD: Final = 3
# Cooldown (seconds) after LAN writes are suppressed for a device before the next
# command probes the LAN write path again. Aligned with LAN_RESCAN_INTERVAL so a
# device that started confirming after a rescan/firmware change is re-tried at
# roughly the same cadence it would be re-correlated.
LAN_WRITE_SUPPRESS_SECONDS: Final = 300
# Age (seconds) past which a device's last successful LAN exchange is treated as
# stale, marking its 'lan' transport health unavailable. Set just above the 60s
# default poll so a single missed poll is tolerated.
LAN_STALE_SECONDS: Final = 90
# Time-to-live (seconds) for a scan MAC↔IP correlation. A devStatus read is only
# applied for an IP whose correlation is fresher than this, guarding against
