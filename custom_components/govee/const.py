#   "auto"       -> convert only for SKUs in FAHRENHEIT_REPORTING_SKUS (default)

#   H717A (smart kettle): reports its temperature in °F under the °C-tagged
#     native unit, so 187°F surfaced as 187°C — impossible for a kettle (water
#     boils at 100°C); real value ~86°C (issue #115).
#   H5106 / H5140 (air-quality / CO₂ monitors): report °F as a plain float
#     (e.g. 73.9°F ≈ 23.3°C), surfaced under the °C unit as a "wrong large
#     value". Confirmed by reporter diagnostics (issue #116) — they are NOT
#     centi-encoded, just Fahrenheit; same class as #72/#78/#96.
