"""Per-device transport-health tracking.

Extracted from coordinator.py for testability + cohesion (audit H1).
Tracks last-success / last-failure timestamps and availability per
(device, transport) where transport ∈ {cloud_api, mqtt, ble}.

The tracker is callback-free and side-effect-free — it owns the
transport-health dict and the policy for staleness decisions, but does
not know about the coordinator, devices, or BLE/MQTT clients. All
inputs are passed in explicitly.
