"""Per-device transport-health tracking.

Extracted from coordinator.py for testability + cohesion (audit H1).
Tracks last-success / last-failure timestamps and availability per
(device, transport) where transport ∈ {cloud_api, mqtt, ble}.

The tracker is callback-free and side-effect-free — it owns the
transport-health dict and the policy for staleness decisions, but does
not know about the coordinator, devices, or BLE/MQTT clients. All
inputs are passed in explicitly.

        Modelled on :meth:`refresh_ble_staleness`. The ``lan`` health entry is
        auto-provisioned for *every* device (groups, sensors, BLE-only devices
        included), but only devices that answered the LAN discovery scan and
        correlated to a ``device_id`` are LAN-active. This gives the otherwise
        blank ``lan`` entry a meaningful failure reason:

        * A device not in ``lan_active_ids`` is marked unavailable with reason
          ``no_lan_presence`` — it never participated in LAN at all (the common
          case for groups, sensors and BLE-only devices).

          :data:`~custom_components.govee.const.LAN_STALE_SECONDS` is marked
          unavailable with reason ``stale_lan`` — it was reachable but has gone
          quiet, so the write-health gate must stop routing writes to it.

        Recording asymmetry vs MQTT (intentional — the LAN control tier relies
        on it): for LAN a confirmed inbound devStatus *read* records success
        and a confirmed *write* records send + success, but an unconfirmed or
        failed write records FAILURE. MQTT, which cannot verify by read, stamps
        a bare send-only success on publish. Do **not** add a send-only success
        for LAN: a verify-by-read transport must never report a write the
        device silently dropped as healthy, or a stranded device would look
        available.
