        The LAN control tier sits between BLE and MQTT (BLE > LAN > MQTT >
        REST). A LAN write is fire-and-forget and unacknowledged, so this
        method confirms it by reading the device's reported state back within
        ``LAN_WRITE_CONFIRM_TIMEOUT`` and requiring an exact (power) /
        within-tolerance (brightness) match. Anything that cannot be confirmed —
        LAN disabled, a group / numeric id, an uncorrelated device, an
        unavailable LAN read-health, a write-suppression cooldown, a non-LAN
        command, a failed send, no reply, or a value mismatch — returns ``False``
        so the caller falls through to MQTT/REST, which re-applies the optimistic
        state and actually delivers the write. A device is therefore never
        stranded on a LAN write the firmware ignored.

        Transport health vs. write viability are kept separate (issue #57): a
        confirm miss (no reply / value mismatch) NEVER marks the ``lan`` transport
        unavailable — that produced a flap synced to control activity. Health is
        read-driven (the poll read + unsolicited pushes); a run of confirm misses
        only suppresses LAN *write attempts* (:meth:`_note_lan_write_miss`) so the
        device's writes route to MQTT/REST without paying the confirm timeout,
        while its LAN reads — and the connectivity sensor — keep working.

        On a confirmed write the LAN send + success are recorded and the
        device's real reported values are locked in via :meth:`_apply_lan_read`;
        an optimistic update is applied immediately (before the blocking confirm
        read) so the UI responds in ~0ms.
