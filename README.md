## What's This?

Ever wanted your Govee lights to actually *talk* to Home Assistant? This integration gives you:

- **Full light control** — brightness, RGB colors, color temp, the works
- **Scene magic** — your Govee scenes become HA scenes
- **RGBIC segment control** — paint each segment a different color OR control all segments together as one
- **Real-time sync** — optional MQTT for instant updates (bye-bye polling lag)

---

## Get Started

### 1. Grab Your API Key

In the **Govee Home** app: **Profile** → **Settings** → **Apply for API Key**

Check your email in ~5 minutes.

### 2. Install via HACS

Click the button above, search "Govee", hit **Download**, restart Home Assistant.

### 3. Add the Integration

**Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** → **Govee**

Enter your API key. Want instant updates? Add your Govee email/password for MQTT.

## What Works

| Device | Features |
|--------|----------|
| **LED Lights & Strips** | On/off, brightness, RGB, color temp |
| **RGBIC Strips** | All the above + per-segment colors |
| **Fans** | On/off, speed (Low/Medium/High), oscillation, preset modes |
| **Heaters** | On/off, target temperature (16-35°C), fan speed control |
| **Air Purifiers** | On/off, mode selection (Sleep/Low/High/Custom) |
| **HDMI Sync Boxes** | On/off, HDMI input selection (1-4) |
| **Leak Sensors (H5058/H5054/H5055)** | Moisture detection, battery, sensor/gateway connectivity, button press events |

> **Note:** Cloud-enabled devices only. Bluetooth-only devices need a different integration.
> Leak sensors require a Govee hub (H5043/H5044) and email/password login for MQTT.

## RGBIC Segment Control

For devices with RGB segments (like LED strips), you can choose how to control them globally or per-device:

### Segment Control Modes

| Mode | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **Individual Segments** | Control each segment separately with different colors (default) |
| **Grouped Segments** | Control all segments together as a single light — perfect for synchronized effects |
| **Disabled** | Hide all segment entities if you don't need them |

### Global vs Per-Device Configuration

You can configure segment control in two ways:

1. **Global Setting** — Apply one mode to all RGBIC devices
   - In **Configure**, set "Global Segment Control Mode"
   - All devices without per-device settings use this mode

2. **Per-Device Settings** (NEW) — Different modes for different devices
   - In **Configure**, select which devices to customize
   - Set individual modes for each device (e.g., strips as individual, spotlights as grouped)
   - Devices not configured per-device fall back to the global setting

### How to Configure

**To set up segment control:**

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Govee** → **Configure**
2. Set your **Global Segment Control Mode** (fallback for all devices)
3. If you have RGBIC devices, you'll see additional steps:
   - Select which devices to customize with per-device settings
   - Set individual modes for each selected device
4. Save — entities are automatically created/removed based on your selections

**Example scenario:**
- Global mode: Individual segments (default)
- Customize per-device:
  - LED Strip A (living room): Individual segments
  - LED Strip B (kitchen): Grouped segments (for synced effects)
  - Spotlight (bedroom): Disabled (don't need segment control)

## Real-time Updates

Polling is *so* 2020. Add your Govee account credentials during setup for instant state sync via AWS IoT MQTT.

No credentials? Polling works fine (every 60 seconds by default).

---

## Device Groups

Created groups of lights in the Govee app? Enable **"Enable group devices"** in the integration's ⚙️ Configure options to surface them as single light entities.

Why use a group entity instead of a Home Assistant helper? A command to the group is sent **once** and Govee's cloud syncs it to every member — so the lights change together, instead of Home Assistant firing a separate command at each light (which can arrive at slightly different times over Wi-Fi).

Caveats:
- Group state is best-effort — groups can't be polled, so the entity may not reflect changes made outside Home Assistant.
- Group lights support power, brightness, and color only (no scenes, segments, music, or DreamView).

## Thermometers & Sensors

Govee thermometer/hygrometer readings (H5075, H5100, H5110, H5179, H5109…) come from the Govee **cloud**, and the cloud only refreshes them on Govee's own schedule:

- **WiFi-native sensors** (e.g. H5179): roughly every 10 minutes.
- **Bluetooth sensors behind a gateway** (e.g. H5075/H5110 reporting through an **H5151** WiFi gateway): the gateway batch-uploads every **15–60 minutes**.

So a value can look "frozen" even though polling is perfectly healthy — the integration is faithfully showing the latest value Govee has. This is a Govee cloud limitation, not an integration bug (the same applies to govee2mqtt and homebridge-govee). Each thermometer exposes a **"Last Changed"** diagnostic timestamp showing when the value last moved, so you can see how old it is.

**Want real-time readings?** Govee thermometers broadcast their reading over Bluetooth every couple of seconds. To read them locally:

1. Enable Home Assistant's built-in [**Govee Bluetooth (`govee_ble`)**](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/govee_ble/) integration for any sensor in Bluetooth range of your HA host.
2. For sensors that are far away (the reason you use an H5151 gateway in the first place), put an **[ESPHome Bluetooth proxy](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy.html)** near them.

That gives ~2-second updates locally, independent of the Govee cloud.

> **Reading shows ~1.8× too high?** (e.g. 74 instead of 23) — your device reports °F via the API. Set **Temperature unit from Govee API** to **Fahrenheit** in the integration's ⚙️ Configure options.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Devices not showing | Make sure they're WiFi devices, not Bluetooth-only |
| Slow updates | Enable MQTT or reduce poll interval in options |
| Rate limit errors | Increase poll interval (Govee allows 100 req/min) |
| Thermometer reads ~1.8× too high (e.g. 74 instead of 23) | The device reports °F via the API. Set **Temperature unit from Govee API** to **Fahrenheit** in the integration's ⚙️ Configure options to convert to °C |

## Debug Logging

When troubleshooting issues, enable debug logging to capture detailed information about what the integration is doing.

### Enable Debug Logging

**Option 1: From the Integration (Recommended)**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find the **Govee** integration card
3. Click the **three dots menu** (⋮) on the integration card
4. Select **Enable debug logging**
5. Reproduce the issue (turn on a light, trigger the error, etc.)
6. Return to the integration card, click the three dots menu again
7. Select **Disable debug logging**
8. Your browser will download a log file automatically

**Option 2: Via configuration.yaml**

For issues during startup or if you need persistent debug logging, add to your `configuration.yaml` and restart:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.govee: debug
```

### Viewing Logs

- Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**
- Click **Load Full Logs** to see everything
- Use the search box to filter for "govee"

See [Home Assistant Logger docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logger/) for more details.

### Gathering Logs for Issues

When opening an issue, include relevant log entries. Here's what to capture:

1. **Enable debug logging** (see above)
2. **Reproduce the issue** (turn on/off a device, change a scene, etc.)
3. **Copy the relevant log entries**

**What to include:**
- Logs from when Home Assistant starts (shows device discovery)
- Logs from when the issue occurs
- Any error messages or tracebacks

**Example log snippet to include:**
```
2024-01-15 10:30:45 DEBUG (MainThread) [custom_components.govee.coordinator] Device: Living Room Light (AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF:00:11) type=devices.types.light
2024-01-15 10:30:45 DEBUG (MainThread) [custom_components.govee.coordinator]   Capability: type=devices.capabilities.on_off instance=powerSwitch
```

**Before posting**, redact sensitive information:
- Replace device IDs with `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`
- Remove any email addresses or account IDs
